## Code Quality Improvements

### Course Color Handling
**Old**: Used hash-based random color from preset array
```dart
final colors = [Colors.blue, Colors.green, Colors.purple, ...];
final color = colors[course.id.hashCode % colors.length];
```

**New**: Uses actual course color from database
```dart
Color color = Colors.blue;
if (course.color != null && course.color!.isNotEmpty) {
  try {
    final hexColor = course.color!.replaceAll('#', '');
    color = Color(int.parse('FF$hexColor', radix: 16));
  } catch (e) {
    color = Colors.blue; // Fallback
  }
}
```

This ensures consistency between:
- Course cards in dashboard
- Course detail screen header
- All course-related UI elements
