## Technical Details

### Services Used
- `AnnouncementService.getAnnouncements()` - Load announcements
- Navigation to 4 different screens
- Automatic reload after mutations

### State Management
```dart
List<Announcement> _announcements;          // Loaded data
List<Announcement> _filteredAnnouncements;  // Filtered data
ClassworkType _filter;                      // Current filter
String _searchQuery;                        // Search text
bool _isLoading;                            // Loading state
```

### Performance Considerations
- Client-side search filtering (fast)
- Reload only after mutations (not on every navigation)
- Lazy loading of detail data (on tap)
