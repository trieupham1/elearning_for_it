## Backend Integration Points

**To Complete**:

1. **Announcements API** (`/api/courses/:courseId/announcements`):
   - GET: Fetch all announcements with comments
   - POST: Create new announcement (instructor only)
   - POST `/:id/comments`: Add comment to announcement

2. **Classwork API** (`/api/courses/:courseId/classwork`):
   - GET: Fetch assignments, quizzes, materials
   - Filter by type query parameter
   - Include submission status for students

3. **People API** (`/api/courses/:courseId/people`):
   - GET: Fetch instructors and students
   - Return separate arrays for teachers and classmates

4. **Messaging API** (`/api/messages`):
   - GET `/:userId`: Fetch conversation with user
   - POST: Send new message
   - PUT `/:id/read`: Mark message as read
   - Consider WebSocket/Socket.io for real-time updates

5. **Notification Integration**:
   - Trigger `notifyNewAnnouncement` when announcement is posted
   - Trigger `notifyNewComment` when comment is added
   - Trigger `notifyPrivateMessage` when message is sent
