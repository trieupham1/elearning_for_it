## Group Scoping Logic

### For Students:
- Fetches student's groups in the course
- Shows announcements where:
  - `groupIds` contains at least one of student's groups, OR
  - `groupIds` is empty (announcement for all students)

### For Instructors:
- Shows ALL announcements in the course (no filtering)

### Creating Announcements:
- Empty `groupIds` array = visible to all students in course
- Populated `groupIds` array = visible only to students in those specific groups

## Tracking Features

### View Tracking:
- **One view per user** (prevents duplicate tracking)
- Stores: userId, viewedAt timestamp
- Accessible via tracking endpoint

### Download Tracking:
- **Multiple downloads allowed** per user (tracks every download)
- Stores: userId, fileName, downloadedAt timestamp
- Validates file exists before tracking

### Analytics Dashboard:
- Unique viewer count vs total views
- Unique downloader count vs total downloads
- Per-file download statistics
- Full audit trail with timestamps
- Student details (ID, name, email)

### CSV Export:
- Complete tracking history in spreadsheet format
- Includes both views and downloads
- Ready for analysis in Excel/Google Sheets

## Model Schema Reference

```javascript
{
  courseId: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  content: String,
  authorId: ObjectId,
  authorName: String,
  groupIds: [ObjectId], // empty = all groups
  attachments: [{ name, url, size }],
  comments: [{ 
    userId: ObjectId, 
    userName: String, 
    userAvatar: String,
    text: String, 
    createdAt: Date 
  }],
  viewedBy: [{ 
    userId: ObjectId, 
    viewedAt: Date 
  }],
  downloadedBy: [{ 
    userId: ObjectId, 
    fileName: String, 
    downloadedAt: Date 
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```
