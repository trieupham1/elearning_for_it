## 💡 Code Highlights

### Silent Tracking
```dart
// Doesn't block UI or show errors
try {
  await _announcementService.trackView(announcementId);
} catch (e) {
  // Silent failure - tracking shouldn't interrupt user
}
```

### Two-Stage File Upload
```dart
// 1. User picks files (pending state)
// 2. Upload on submit (uploaded state)
// Better UX than blocking during pick
```

### Role-Based UI
```dart
bool get _isInstructor => 
  currentUser?.role == 'instructor' || 
  currentUser?.role == 'admin';

// Show FAB only for instructors
floatingActionButton: _isInstructor ? FAB(...) : null
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Start with backend** - API first, then frontend
2. **Silent tracking** - Don't interrupt user flow
3. **Role-based UI** - Check permissions everywhere
4. **Auto-reload** - Refresh lists after mutations
5. **Search client-side** - Faster for small datasets
6. **Reusable patterns** - Easy to apply to other features
