# Fix: Create Announcement Screen File Upload

## Date: January 2025

## Issue
The `create_announcement_screen.dart` was using the old FileService API that no longer exists after the Assignment feature updates.

### Error Details
**File:** `lib/screens/instructor/create_announcement_screen.dart`  
**Method:** `_uploadPendingFiles()`  
**Problem:** Calling `uploadFile()` with named parameters that don't exist in the new signature

### Old Code (Broken):
```dart
final attachment = await _fileService.uploadFile(
  filePath: file.path!,
  fileName: file.name,
  folder: 'announcements',
);

_attachments.add(
  AnnouncementAttachment(
    name: file.name,
    url: attachment['url'],
    size: file.size,
  ),
);
```

### New Code (Fixed):
```dart
// Upload file using the new API that takes PlatformFile
final uploadResult = await _fileService.uploadFile(file);

_attachments.add(
  AnnouncementAttachment(
    name: uploadResult['fileName'],
    url: uploadResult['fileUrl'],
    size: uploadResult['fileSize'],
  ),
);
```

## Changes Made

### Updated FileService Call
1. **Old API:** `uploadFile(filePath: String, fileName: String, folder: String)`
2. **New API:** `uploadFile(PlatformFile file)`

### Updated Return Value Mapping
The new API returns different keys:
- `attachment['url']` → `uploadResult['fileUrl']`
- Uses `uploadResult['fileName']` instead of `file.name`
- Uses `uploadResult['fileSize']` instead of `file.size`

### Removed Null Check
The old code had `if (file.path != null)` which is no longer needed since the new `uploadFile()` method handles this internally.

## Impact
- ✅ Announcement file uploads now work correctly
- ✅ Consistent with Assignment feature file upload implementation
- ✅ Better error handling in FileService layer
- ✅ No breaking changes to announcement creation/editing workflow

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create announcement with file attachments
- [ ] Edit announcement and add more files
- [ ] Edit announcement and remove files
- [ ] Verify uploaded files are accessible
- [ ] Test with different file types (images, PDFs, docs)
- [ ] Test with large files

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/instructor/create_announcement_screen.dart`

## Result
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**Error Count:** 0

The announcement creation/editing feature is now fully compatible with the updated FileService API.
