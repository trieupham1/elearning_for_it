## üéØ What You Get

When you export a student's complete profile, you get **EVERYTHING** related to that student in one file:

## üöÄ Method 1: Using Postman (Easiest)

### Step 1: Get Student ID

First, you need the student's MongoDB ID. You can get this by:

**Option A: Export all students first**
```
GET /api/export/users/excel?role=student
```
Open the Excel file and find the student's `_id`

**Option B: Query directly in MongoDB**
```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or shell
db.users.findOne({ username: "student1" })
// Copy the _id value
```

**Option C: From your Flutter app**
```dart
// When logged in as that student
final user = await authService.getCurrentUser();
print(user.id); // This is the student ID
```

---

### Step 2: Export in Postman

1. **Import the collection** (if you haven't):
   - Import `E-Learning_Export_API.postman_collection.json`

2. **Login** (if you haven't):
   - Run **Auth** ‚Üí **Login (Instructor)**
   - Token auto-saves

3. **Run the export**:
   - Go to **Export Student (Complete Profile)** folder
   - Open **Export Student Complete Data (Excel)**
   - Replace `YOUR_STUDENT_ID` in URL with actual student ID
   - Example: `.../student/673123abc456def789/excel`
   - Click **Send and Download**

4. **File downloads!**
   - Filename: `database_export_2025-10-17T10-30-00.xlsx`
   - Contains 9 sheets with all student data

---

## üîß Method 2: Direct URL in Browser

If you have a valid token, you can paste this URL directly:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/export/student/YOUR_STUDENT_ID/excel
```

But you'll need to add the Authorization header somehow (browser extension like ModHeader).

---

## üíª Method 3: Using Code

### JavaScript/Node.js:
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
const fs = require('fs');

async function exportStudent(studentId, token) {
  const url = `http://localhost:5000/api/export/student/${studentId}/excel`;
  
  const response = await axios.get(url, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    responseType: 'arraybuffer'
  });

  fs.writeFileSync(`student_${studentId}.xlsx`, response.data);
  console.log('‚úÖ Student data exported!');
}

// Usage
exportStudent('673123abc456def789', 'your_token_here');
```

### Python:
```python
import requests

def export_student(student_id, token):
    url = f'http://localhost:5000/api/export/student/{student_id}/excel'
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    with open(f'student_{student_id}.xlsx', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    
    print('‚úÖ Student data exported!')

# Usage
export_student('673123abc456def789', 'your_token_here')
```

### Flutter/Dart:
```dart
Future<void> exportStudent(String studentId, String token) async {
  final url = 'http://localhost:5000/api/export/student/$studentId/excel';
  
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse(url),
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'},
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    final file = File('${dir.path}/student_$studentId.xlsx');
    await file.writeAsBytes(response.bodyBytes);
    print('‚úÖ Student data exported to ${file.path}');
  }
}
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can students export their own data?**  
A: Currently no - only instructors/admins can export. But you can add a self-export feature if needed.

**Q: How do I get the student ID?**  
A: Export all users first with `/api/export/users/excel?role=student`, or query your database.

**Q: What if the student has no data?**  
A: Empty sheets will still be created. The export will succeed but show "No data found" in those sheets.

**Q: Can I export multiple students at once?**  
A: Not directly, but you can loop through student IDs in code and export each one.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
A: Usually 1-3 seconds per student, depending on how much data they have.

**Q: Where do the files go?**  
A: Downloads to your Downloads folder (Postman) or `backend/exported_data/` folder (server).
