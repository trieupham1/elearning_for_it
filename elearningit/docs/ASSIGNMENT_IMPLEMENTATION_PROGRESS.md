## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

Following the same successful pattern as Announcements:

1. **Phase 1: Instructor Create Screen** (Next)
   - Build rich form
   - Test assignment creation
   - Verify backend integration

2. **Phase 2: Student View/Submit Screen**
   - Build detail view
   - Implement file upload
   - Test submission flow

3. **Phase 3: Instructor Tracking Dashboard**
   - Build comprehensive table
   - Implement grading interface
   - Add filters, search, sort
   - Test CSV export

4. **Phase 4: Integration**
   - Add to Classwork tab
   - Test navigation flow
   - End-to-end testing

## 📝 Notes

- All backend routes use the same authentication middleware as announcements
- Group scoping works identically to announcements (empty = all groups)
- Notifications are automatically sent for new assignments and graded submissions
- CSV export supports both individual assignments and entire courses
- File validation happens both client-side and server-side
- The `createdByName` field prevents the same validation issue we had with announcements
