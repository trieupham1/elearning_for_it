   - Connect `chat_screen.dart` to messages API

2. **Testing:**
   - Test all endpoints with Postman/Thunder Client
   - Test permission checks
   - Test notification triggers
   - Test search and filter functionality

3. **Documentation:**
   - Review `docs/BACKEND_API_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed API specs
