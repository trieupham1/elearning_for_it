# Group Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive group functionality to the e-learning platform, allowing courses to have multiple groups and enabling instructors to assign students to specific groups during invitation or join request approval.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Fixed Group Routes (`backend/routes/groups.js`)
- **Issue**: Routes were using `studentIds` but the model uses `members`
- **Fixed**: Updated all references from `studentIds` to `members`:
  - GET `/` - List groups with populated members
  - GET `/:id` - Get single group with populated members
  - POST `/:groupId/students` - Add students to group
  - DELETE `/:groupId/students/:studentId` - Remove student from group

### 2. Registered Group Routes (`backend/server.js`)
- Added `const groupRoutes = require('./routes/groups');`
- Added `app.use('/api/groups', groupRoutes);`
- Groups API now accessible at `/api/groups`

### 3. Updated Course Invitation (`backend/routes/notifications.js`)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /notifications/course-invitation`
- **New Parameter**: `groupId` (optional)
- **Features**:
  - Validates group exists and belongs to course
  - Includes group name in invitation message
  - Stores `groupId` and `groupName` in notification data
- **Auto-assign**: When student accepts invitation, they're automatically added to the specified group

### 4. Updated Join Request Flow (`backend/routes/courses.js`)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /courses/:id/join`
- **New Parameter**: `groupId` (optional)
- **Features**:
  - Validates group exists and belongs to course
  - Includes group name in join request message
  - Stores `groupId` and `groupName` in notification data

- **Endpoint**: `POST /courses/:id/join-request/:notificationId/respond`
- **Features**:
  - When instructor approves request with `groupId`, student is automatically added to that group

## Frontend Changes

### 5. Created Group Model (`lib/models/group.dart`)
```dart
class Group {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String courseId;
  final List<Member> members;
  final String createdBy;
  final String? description;
  final DateTime? createdAt;
  final DateTime? updatedAt;
}

class Member {
  final String id;
  final String fullName;
  final String email;
  final String studentId;
}
```

### 6. Created Group Service (`lib/services/group_service.dart`)
**Methods**:
- `getGroupsByCourse(courseId)` - Fetch all groups for a course
- `getGroup(groupId)` - Fetch single group details
- `createGroup({name, courseId, createdBy, description})` - Create new group
- `updateGroup({groupId, name, description})` - Update group
- `deleteGroup(groupId)` - Delete group
- `addStudentsToGroup({groupId, studentIds})` - Add students to group
- `removeStudentFromGroup({groupId, studentId})` - Remove student from group

### 7. Updated People Tab (`lib/screens/course_tabs/people_tab.dart`)
**New Features**:
- **Groups Section**: Shows all groups in the course
- **Create Group Button**: Instructors can create new groups
- **Expandable Group Cards**: Click to expand and see group members
- **Group Management**: Delete groups (instructor only)
- **Ungrouped Students Section**: Shows students not in any group
- **Member Management**: Message students in groups

**UI Structure**:
```

│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Group 2 (expandable)
│   └── ...
└── Ungrouped Students
```

### 8. Updated Invitation Dialog (`lib/screens/manage_students_screen.dart`)
**New Component**: `_CourseInvitationDialog`
**Features**:
- Multi-course selection with checkboxes
- For each selected course:
  - Automatically loads groups for that course
  - Shows dropdown to select group (optional)

3. When course is selected, group dropdown appears below it
4. Instructor can select a group or leave as "No specific group"
5. Send invitation with selected courses and their respective groups

### 9. Updated Join Request Dialog (`lib/screens/available_courses_screen.dart`)
**Features**:
- Before sending join request, loads groups for the course
- If groups exist, shows dialog to select group
- Options:
  - Select specific group (shows member count and description)
  - "No specific group" option
- Sends `groupId` with join request

**UI Flow**:
1. Student clicks "Request to Join"
2. System loads groups for course
3. If groups exist, shows group selection dialog
