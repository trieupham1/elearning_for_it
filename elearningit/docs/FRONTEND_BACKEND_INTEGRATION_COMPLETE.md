## 🎯 Testing Guide

### Before Testing:
1. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   Should see: `Server running on port 5000` and `Connected to MongoDB`

2. **Ensure MongoDB has data:**
   - At least one course created
   - Users enrolled in the course
   - (Optional) Some announcements/classwork for testing

3. **Run Flutter App:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No data showing in tabs"
**Solution:** Make sure:
1. Backend server is running on port 5000
2. MongoDB is connected
3. You have data in the database for that course
4. Check Flutter console for API errors

### "401 Unauthorized" errors
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check that auth token is being sent in headers
3. Token might be expired - try logging in again

### "Students can only message instructors" error
**Solution:** This is correct! The backend enforces this rule. Students cannot message other students.

### API not responding
**Solution:**
1. Check backend terminal for errors
2. Verify backend URL in `lib/config/api_config.dart`
3. Check if using `http://localhost:5000` or `http://10.0.2.2:5000` (for Android emulator)
